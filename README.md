# create-access-objects-constructor-notation

first a constructor function defines a template for the hotels
next two diferrent instances of this type of hotel object are created
the first represents a hotel called "Quay" and the other called "park"

having created instances of theses objects you can then
access their properties and methods using the same dot notaition
that you use with all others objects

in these example data from objects is accessed and write into the page the html for this example changes to accommodate the extra hotel

for each hotel a variable is created to hold the hotel name followed by space and the word rooms

the line after it adds to that variable with the number of available in that hotel

(the += operator is used to add content to an existing variable)...
